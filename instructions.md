### Project title

MusicHub

### What and why?

I would like to make an app that manages all your music libraries in one place. There are many music services available but they have different intefaces and using them at the same time is challenging. Also, people have their libraries spead across different such music platforms and it is a hassle to move them all to one place, which sometimes is not an option.

### For whom?

This is for anyone who used/signed up for the services at different timse and it is too much work to transfer playlists and songs they own to another music platform so you used multiple services together or they simply looking for one stop for all their music with good interface.

### How?

We can use avaliable services of those music platforms and unify and integrate into our system so user only has to log into these services and they can use all of them together.

### Scope

I think the implemenation itself should be straightforward, although making frontend with exciting UI could require some creativity. The work would invlove backend with unified APIs of the other music services which for handful of popular services would be doable with even 3-4 people in time assigned for this project.
